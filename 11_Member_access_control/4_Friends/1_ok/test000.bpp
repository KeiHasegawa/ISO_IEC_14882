/*
 * A friend of a class is a function or class that is not a member of the class
 * but is permitted to use the private and protected member names from the
 * class. The name of a friend is not in the scope of the class, and the
 * friend is not called with the member access operators (5.2.5) unless it is
 * a member of another class. Example: the following example illustrates
 * the differences between members and friends:
 */
#include <stdio.h>

class X {
  int a;
  friend void friend_set(X*, int);
public:
  void member_set(int);
  void print() const { printf("a = %d\n", a); }
};

void friend_set(X* p, int i) { p->a = i; }
void X::member_set(int i) { a = i; }

int main()
{
  X obj;
  friend_set(&obj,10);
  obj.print();
  obj.member_set(9);
  obj.print();
  return 0;
}
