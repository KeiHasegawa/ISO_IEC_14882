 * If a friend declaration appears in a local class (9.8) and the name

 * the program is ill-formed. For a friend class declaration, if there is no
 * prior declaration, the class that is specified belongs to the innermost
 * enclosing non-class scope, but if it is subsequently referenced, its name
 * is not found by name lookup until a matching declaration is provided in
 * the innermost enclosing nonclass scope.
