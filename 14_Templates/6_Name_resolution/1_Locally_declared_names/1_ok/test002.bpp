 * A lookup that finds an injected-class-name (10.2) can result in an

 * base class). If all of the injected-class-names that are found refer to
 * specializations of the same class template, and if the name is followed by
 * a template-argument-list, the reference refers to the class template itself
 * and not a specialization thereof, and is not ambiguous.
