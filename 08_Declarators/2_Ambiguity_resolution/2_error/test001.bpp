/*
 * The ambiguity arising from the similarity between a function-style cast and
 * a type-id can occur in different contexts. The ambiguity appears as a choice
 * between a function-style cast expression and a declaration of a type. The
 * resolution is that any construct that could possibly be a type-id in its
 * syntactic context shall be considered a type-id.
