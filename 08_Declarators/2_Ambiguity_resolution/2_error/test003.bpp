/*
 * Another ambiguity arises in a parameter-declaration-clause of a function
 * declaration, or in a type-id that is the operand of a sizeof or typeid
 * operator, when a type-name is nested in parentheses. In this case, the
 * choice is between the declaration of a parameter of type pointer to function
 * and the declaration of a parameter with redundant parentheses around the
 * declarator-id. The resolution is to consider the type-name as a
 * simple-type-specifier rather than a declarator-id.
