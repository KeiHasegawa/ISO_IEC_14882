/*
 * In an explicit destructor call, the destructor name appears as a . followed
 * by a type-name that names the destructor's class type. The invocation of a
 * destructor is subject to the usual rules for member functions (9.3), that
 * is, if the object is not of the destructorfs class type and not of a class
 * derived from the destructor's class type, the program has undefined behavior
 * (except that invoking delete on a null pointer has no effect).
