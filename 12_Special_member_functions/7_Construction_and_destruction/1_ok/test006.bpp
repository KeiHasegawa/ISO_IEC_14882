/*
 * The typeid operator (5.2.8) can be used during construction or destruction
 * (12.6.2). When typeid is used in a constructor (including from the
 * mem-initializer for a data member) or in a destructor, or used in a function
 * called (directly or indirectly) from a constructor or destructor, if the
 * operand of typeid refers to the object under construction or destruction,
 * typeid yields the type_info representing the constructor or destructor's
 * class. If the operand of typeid refers to the object under construction or
 * destruction and the static type of the operand is neither the constructor
 * or destructor's class nor one of its bases, the result of typeid is
 * undefined.
 *
 * Dynamic_casts (5.2.7) can be used during construction or destruction
 * (12.6.2). When a dynamic_cast is used in a constructor (including from the
 * mem-initializer for a data member) or in a destructor, or used in a function
 * called (directly or indirectly) from a constructor or destructor, if the
 * operand of the dynamic_cast refers to the object under construction or
 * destruction, this object is considered to be a most derived object that has
 * the type of the constructor or destructor's class. If the operand of the
 * dynamic_cast refers to the object under construction or destruction and the
 * static type of the operand is not a pointer to or object of the constructor
 * or destructor's own class or one of its bases, the dynamic_cast results in
 * undefined behavior.
