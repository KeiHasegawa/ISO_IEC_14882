/*
 * A union of the form
 *
 *   union { member-specification } ;
 *
 * is called an anonymous union; it defines an unnamed object of unnamed type.
 * The member-specification of an anonymous union shall only define non-static
 * data members. [Note: nested types and functions cannot be declared within an
 * anonymous union. ] The names of the members of an anonymous union shall be
 * distinct from the names of any other entity in the scope in which the
 * anonymous union is declared. For the purpose of name lookup, after the
 * anonymous union definition, the members of the anonymous union are
 * considered to have been defined in the scope in which the anonymous union
 * is declared.
